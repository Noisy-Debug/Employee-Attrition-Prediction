# üß† Employee Attrition Prediction System

This project implements a machine learning-based predictive system to forecast employee attrition. It uses the **XGBoost classifier**, trained on historical HR data, to help organizations proactively retain top talent. It also includes a **Gradio web application** to simulate predictions based on user inputs.

# üìä Problem Statement

Traditional HR approaches like exit interviews are reactive and provide little time to prevent turnover. This project aims to **predict attrition early** by analyzing patterns in employee data.

# üîç Key Features

- **4 ML Models Compared**: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost (see: 3-SRC/ML Models Testing.py)
- **Best Accuracy**: XGBoost (92%).
- **Live Predictions**: Built with Gradio to visualize likely outcomes.
- **Insightful Charts**: Understand which roles, departments, and conditions contribute to attrition.

# üí° Technologies Used

- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- Gradio (for Web App)
- Joblib (for model saving)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

# üìä Results and Insights

- XGBoost achieved 92% accuracy
- Employees with low income, poor work-life balance, and low job satisfaction were more likely to leave
- Highest attrition observed in Sales and R&D
- Roles most at risk are Sales Executives and Laboratory Technicians

# üîÆ Future Enhancements

- Implement Explainable AI (XAI) methods
- Add bias/fairness analysis for sensitive features
- Expand dataset across multiple organizations
